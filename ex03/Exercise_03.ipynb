    "In the previous exercise sheet on the game _battleships_, we studied prior and posterior probabilities of getting a hit by enumerating all possible locations of one boat. We established that it is computationally unfeasible to obtain the full posterior by enumeration for the number of ships in the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, to render the problem tractable, we need to approximate the posterior over hits given hit/miss observations. We achieve this through _Monte Carlo_ sampling. Instead of enumerating _all_ board states, we randomly sample `nb_samples` valid board states (i.e. configurations of ship arrangements on the board) and use their sum to estimate the posterior.\n",

    "- `random_agent.py`: The random agent (just selects a previously unobserved location at random)\n",
    "- `MC_Agent`: this is where you should implement the Monte Carlo Agent for the virtual opponent. Initially, it randomly selects a query location (i.e. you can play the game by running `main.py`, but the computer makes uninformed moves."

    "Your task is to replace the method `select_observation` in the class `MCAgent` by a routine that samples board states to estimate the posterior probability of getting a hit, and then choosing the location that maximizes this probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of observations is saved in the variable `self.observed_board`. A `0` is an unobserved location, `-1` a miss or a sunk ship, and a `1` a hit of a ship that is not yet sunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `select_observation`, we first define a variable `score_board` through which we will assign scores to each field. Therefore it has the shape of the `self.observed_board`.\n",
    "\n",
    "_The key idea of the Monte Carlo agent is to sum up many possible boat placements and choose the location with the largest score (most boats placed) as new query location._\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how to proceed (see comments in the function):\n",
    "1. Check if there is an \"open\" hit, i.e. a hit that does not belong to a sunk ship. If so, reduce the number of samples (e.g. to a tenth) and force possible boats to pass through the hit(s)\n",
    "2. In case there is no open hit, simulate `nb_samples` boats, the location and orientation of which are chosen at random. Track them using the `score_board`.\n",
    "3. Find the location with the largest score and return its indices.\n",
